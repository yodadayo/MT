@article{osti_5606728,
title = {Legged robots that balance},
author = {Raibert, M.H.},
abstractNote = {This book presents implications for theories of human motor control. The author describes the study of physical machines that run and balance on just one leg, including analysis, computer simulation, and laboratory experiments. He reveals that, contrary to expectations, control of such machines is not particularly difficult. He shows how the principles of locomotion with one leg can be extended to systems with several legs and reports preliminary experiments with a quadruped machine that runs using these principles.},
