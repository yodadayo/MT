abstract = { The basic mechanics of human locomotion are associated with vaulting over stiff legs in walking and rebounding on compliant legs in running. However, while rebounding legs well explain the stance dynamics of running, stiff legs cannot reproduce that of walking. With a simple bipedal spring–mass model, we show that not stiff but compliant legs are essential to obtain the basic walking mechanics; incorporating the double support as an essential part of the walking motion, the model reproduces the characteristic stance dynamics that result in the observed small vertical oscillation of the body and the observed out-of-phase changes in forward kinetic and gravitational potential energies. Exploring the parameter space of this model, we further show that it not only combines the basic dynamics of walking and running in one mechanical system, but also reveals these gaits to be just two out of the many solutions to legged locomotion offered by compliant leg behaviour and accessed by energy or speed. },

    abstract = { This paper discusses the mechanics of a rigid rimless spoked wheel, or regular polygon, ‘rolling’ downhill. By ‘rolling’, we mean motions in which the wheel pivots on one ‘support’ spoke until another spoke collides with the ground, followed by transfer of support to that spoke, and so on. We carry out three-dimensional (3D) numerical and analytical stability studies of steady motions of this system. At any fixed, large enough slope, the system has a one-parameter family of stable steady rolling motions. We find analytic approximations for the minimum required slope at a given heading for stable rolling in three dimensions, for the case of many spokes and small slope. The rimless wheel shares some qualitative features with passive–dynamic walking machines; it is a passive 3D system with intermittent impacts and periodic motions. In terms of complexity, it lies between one-dimensional impact oscillators and 3D walking machines. In contrast to a rolling disk on a flat surface which has steady rolling motions that are only neutrally stable at best, the rimless wheel can have asymptotic stability. In the limit as the number of spokes approaches infinity, the behavior of the rimless wheel approaches that of a rolling disk in an averaged sense and becomes neutrally stable. Also, in this averaged sense, the piecewise holonomic system (rimless wheel) approaches a non-holonomic system (disk). }

    abstract = { For three-dimensional (3D) walking control of a biped robot we analyze the dynamics of a 3D inverted pendulum in which motion is constrained to move along an arbitrarily defined plane. This analysis leads us to a simple linear dynamics, the Three-Dimensional Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode (3D-LIPM). The geometric nature of the trajectories under the 3D-LIPM and a method for walking pattern generation are discussed. A simulation result of a walking control using a 12-d.o.f. biped robot model is also shown. }

abstract = {In running, the spring-like axial behavior of stance limbs is a well-known and remarkably general feature. Here we consider how the rotational behavior of limbs affects running stability. It is commonly observed that running animals retract their limbs just prior to ground contact, moving each foot rearward towards the ground. In this study, we employ a conservative spring-mass model to test the effects of swing-leg retraction on running stability. A feed-forward control scheme is applied where the swing-leg is retracted at constant angular velocity throughout the second half of the swing phase. The control scheme allows the spring-mass system to automatically adapt the angle of attack in response to disturbances in forward speed and stance-limb stiffness. Using a return map to investigate system stability, we propose an optimal swing-leg retraction model for the stabilization of flight phase apex height. The results of this study indicate that swing-leg retraction significantly improves the stability of spring-mass running, suggesting that swing-phase limb dynamics may play an important role in the stabilization of running animals.},
